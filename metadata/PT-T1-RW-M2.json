    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice D is the best answer because \"broader\" is a comparative adjective that shows the difference between the tourism business and the destination. The paragraph shows that the tourism business contains many different aspects than just the sites: it also includes \"transportation, hotels and guest accommodations, and services that link the various components of a trip.\" Choice D refers to something that covers a wide range of topics or deals with many elements of something, so accurately shows that tourism deals with many more elements than just the destination. Distractor Explanation: None of the other choices effectively establishes the relationship between the tourism business and the destination. Choice A refers to something that is more noticeable or clear. Choice B refers to something that is not detailed or only covers the main points. Choice C refers to something that is wide in physical space.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The text explains that the \"tourism business\" involves more than just the \"destination\" itself. It then lists several other components: \"transportation, hotels and guest accommodations, and services.\" This indicates that the tourism business covers a wide range of elements. The word that best captures this idea of covering a wide range of topics or elements is \"extensive.\" Therefore, \"broader\" in this context means \"more extensive.\"",
    "feedback_a": "\"More pronounced\" means more noticeable. The text is not saying the tourism business is more noticeable, but that it includes more components.",
    "feedback_b": "\"More general\" often implies a lack of specific detail. While tourism is a general category, the context here is about the wide scope of its components, making \"extensive\" a better fit.",
    "feedback_c": "\"More spacious\" refers to physical space and area. The text is discussing the scope of a business concept, not a physical area.",
    "feedback_d": "This is the correct answer. \"More extensive\" means covering a wider range of elements or topics, which accurately describes how the text contrasts the simple idea of a \"destination\" with the complex \"tourism business.\"",
    "passage_content": "Any country, city, or rural village could be, in fact, its own unique tourism magnet. The tourism business, though, is broader than just the destination. Considerations need to be made for transportation, hotels and guest accommodations, and services that link the various components of a trip, such as guide services in national parks or city bus tours.",

    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice C is the best answer because \"insensible\" is a verb that shows what the trees do to the \"any change in those who walk\" under them. Choice C means \"not notice,\" so it correctly shows that the trees do not notice that different people are present. Distractor Explanation: Choice A refers to an unconscious state, especially when someone is sick or injured. Therefore, it does not apply to trees that do not notice anything. Choice B means \"trivial\" or \"unimportant,\" so does not describe what the trees do to a change in the people under them. Choice D is incorrect because it refers to a lack of thinking or perception of the environment around something. Although trees do not think, Marianne is talking to them as if they were animate creatures that might perceive things if they wanted to.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "In the text, Marianne speaks to the trees, stating they are \"unconscious\" of the emotions they cause and \"insensible\" of any changes in the people around them. The word \"unconscious\" provides a strong clue. Being \"insensible of any change\" means not being aware of or not noticing the change. Therefore, \"unaware\" is the closest synonym in this context.",
    "feedback_a": "\"Comatose\" is a state of deep unconsciousness, usually due to illness or injury. This is far too strong and medical for the context of describing trees.",
    "feedback_b": "\"Negligible\" means insignificant or too small to be important. Marianne is saying the trees don't notice the change, not that the change is negligible.",
    "feedback_c": "This is the correct answer. \"Insensible\" in this context means lacking awareness or feeling. The trees are unaware of the human drama unfolding beneath them.",
    "feedback_d": "\"Insentient\" means inanimate or lacking consciousness. While trees are insentient, the more direct meaning in the sentence, paralleling \"unconscious,\" is that they are not aware of the specific changes.",
    "passage_content": "The following text is from Jane Austen's 1811 novel, \"Sense and Sensibility.\" Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved. \"And you, ye well-known trees,\" said Marianne, \"but you will continue the same, unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade!

The other things are \"fuss\" or \"commotion,\" \"applause\" or \"praise,\" and \"ill will\" or \"hard feelings.\" Choice D refers to anger that is often related to a conflict, so aptly shows that he was very aggressive or hurt others as he \"charged in\" and made money. Distractor Explanation: None of the other choices fits the list of emotional qualities reflecting what happened to Adam on Wall Street. Choice A refers to waste gasses, Choice B to an unpleasant smell, and Choice C to waste products.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The word \"fume\" is part of a list describing the atmosphere surrounding Adam's rise in Wall Street: \"fuss, fume, applause, and ill will.\" The list contains words describing commotion, praise, and negative feelings. \"Fuss,\" \"applause,\" and \"ill will\" are all related to human emotions and reactions. In this context, \"fume\" refers to a display of anger or frustration. \"Ire\" is a synonym for anger.",
    "feedback_a": "\"Exhaust,\" \"stench,\" and \"pollution\" all relate to literal smoke, smells, or contamination. The list describes emotional reactions to Adam's actions, so these physical descriptions are out of place.",

    "correct_answer": "It discusses the study by Walter Mischel to show that there may be alternate explanations in an apparently obvious situation.",
    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice D is the best answer. The topic sentence points out that \"sometimes behaviors have underlying reasons that are not initially apparent,\" and then gives Mischel's experiment as an example. The differing results of Watt's experiment show that a fuller analysis might reveal previously unconsidered explanations for a behavior such as deciding to wait to eat a marshmallow. Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect because, while Watt's experiment revealed a flaw in Mischel's experiment, there is no indication that \"most\" experiments are flawed. Choice B is incorrect because the passage does not say that all experiments should be performed more than once; it only gives an example of a situation where a second experiment revealed more information about a topic. Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not say there is a \"significant problem\" in the way we understand willpower now; the passage points out that a previous problem in understanding was rectified.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The text introduces an idea in the first sentence: \"behaviors have underlying reasons that are not initially apparent.\" It then uses the marshmallow experiment by Mischel as the primary example. It first explains Mischel's initial conclusion (willpower leads to success) and then introduces Watts's later study, which offered an \"alternate explanation\" (economic background is a better predictor). The overall purpose is to use this specific case to illustrate the main idea that first impressions of a situation can be misleading.",
    "feedback_a": "This is too broad. The text uses Watts's study to critique Mischel's study specifically, not to make a general claim that \"most\" behavioral experiments are flawed.",
    "feedback_b": "This is a possible interpretation but not the main purpose. The text uses the example to make a broader point about interpreting behavior, not just to argue for the methodology of repeating experiments.",
    "feedback_c": "While the text does touch on the understanding of willpower, its primary goal is to use the competing explanations for the marshmallow test results as an example of a larger idea about uncovering hidden reasons for behavior.",
    "feedback_d": "This is the correct answer. The text uses the Mischel study and its re-evaluation by Watts as a case study to demonstrate its main point: an obvious-seeming situation (willpower) may have alternate, less apparent explanations (socioeconomic status).",
    "passage_content": "Sometimes, behaviors have underlying reasons that are not initially apparent, as shown through a classic experiment by Walter Mischel. During the 1960s, Mischel placed a marshmallow piece in front of 600 children aged 4-6. About a third were willing to wait 15 minutes to get a whole marshmallow, and those children got higher SAT scores years later. However, Mischel's theory that willpower contributed to future success was somewhat arbitrary. A later experiment conducted by Tyler Watts and associates included a broader analysis of ethnicity and social status and determined that economic background most closely predicted the demonstrated behavior.",

    "correct_answer": "The precarious nature of the freedoms granted to former slaves in Louisiana",
    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice D is the best answer because the cup of liberty is something that \"your old masters\" hold for the slaves. The imagery shows that the cup can be \"dash[ed] from you\" so that it is unclear when the \"scattered contents\" or \"freedoms\" will be given back. In other words, the imagery emphasizes the \"precarious\" or \"unstable\" nature of the freedoms. It is very easy to throw aside or break the gains that have been made. Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect because Lincoln is not saying that the Union is \"generous\" or \"willing to give a lot.\" He is saying that a poor decision will remove everything that has been given so far. Choice B is incorrect because the cup of liberty is what \"your old masters,\" who are slave-owners in Louisiana, hold for slaves. The cup of liberty is not the advances of the Union, only of Louisiana. Choice C is incorrect because the imagery does not include the reaction of people accepting the cup; it says the cup is easy to break.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "Lincoln uses the metaphor of a \"cup of liberty\" being offered to the freed slaves by their \"old masters.\" He then warns that this cup can be \"dashed\" from their lips, leaving them with only \"spilled and scattered contents.\" This powerful imagery highlights how fragile and easily lost this new freedom is. It is not secure but is in a dangerous and uncertain state. \"Precarious\" means not securely held or in position; dangerously likely to fall or collapse. This perfectly captures the meaning of the imagery.",
    "feedback_a": "The imagery emphasizes the potential loss of freedom, not the generosity of the giver. Lincoln's point is about the danger of the situation.",
    "feedback_b": "The imagery is used to describe a specific political situation in Louisiana and the potential for these freedoms to be taken away. It is not about advances made by the Union in general.",
    "feedback_c": "The imagery is not about how people accept freedoms, but about how the freedom itself is in a fragile, easily destroyed state.",

Now, if we reject, and spurn them, we do our utmost to disorganize and disperse them. We in effect say to the white men, \"You are worthless, or worse- -we will neither help you, nor be helped by you.\" To the blacks we say, \"This cup of liberty which these, your old masters, hold to your lips, we will dash from you, and leave you to the chances of gathering the spilled and scattered contents in some vague and undefined when, where, and how.\" In the text, what does the imagery of a cup of liberty mainly serve to emphasize?"

This definition clarifies that not all planners earned the median figure of $73,050. It also explains why a total of 20% of the planners earned less than $45,180 or more than $114,170. If the reader did not know the definition of median wage, then the reason for the wide range in salaries might not make much sense. Distractor Explanation: Choice B is incorrect because the author does not imply that the median wage is \"insufficient\" or \"not good enough.\" The median wage does not give all the necessary details to know the range of salaries, but offers a valid middle point to use as a point of reference. The definition shows how the data can be used to better understand the salary that could be earned as a planner. Choice C is incorrect because there is no \"reason\" or \"cause\" given to explain why planners earn different amounts of money. Choice D is incorrect because there is no link between salary earned and number of jobs. Therefore, a definition of how the salary in the passage was calculated does not support or prove that there will be more jobs in the future.",

Employment of urban and regional planners is projected to grow 11 percent from 2018 to 2028, much faster than the average for all occupations.

The author of Text 1 would probably respond with \"reservation\" or \"some doubt\" because she promotes behavioral activation, a non-invasive method that does not use any medications at all, to retrain the brain into positive patterns. She probably would encourage avoiding invasive methods like introducing drugs into the body if possible. Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 1 indicates that behavioral activation is successful. She does not discuss any other method of treatment, so it is impossible to tell if she would say that \"most\" treatments do not work. Choice C is incorrect because the author of Text 1 does not refer to drug performance at all.

The conclusion of Text 2 calls for developing a new drug. The author of Text 1 would likely not be fully against it, but would have \"reservations\" because it is another medication-based approach, which she sees as less healthy and more invasive than her preferred method.",

    "feedback_b": "This is the correct answer. The author of Text 1 prefers non-intrusive, non-medicinal approaches. While she might not completely disapprove of developing a new drug, she would view it with caution or \"reservation\" due to her promotion of less invasive methods.",

Behavioral activation is a type of talk therapy that helps patients free themselves from negative mood spirals by identifying a connection between actions and emotions, and gradually add small and enjoyable actions back into their lives. The process decreases avoidance, bolsters peer connection, and improves engagement in activities. This non-intrusive solution takes time, but is much healthier than covering the problem with medications. Text 2 Studies have shown that a single ketamine infusion can often rapidly relieve depressive symptoms within hours in people who have not responded to conventional antidepressants, which typically take weeks or months to work. However, widespread use of ketamine for treatment-resistant depression has raised concerns about side effects, including feelings of floating, queasiness, visual distortions, and numbness. These conditions occurred in at least half of the participants of one study, but none persisted for more than four hours. To overcome these problems, ongoing research is necessary to develop a more practical rapid-acting antidepressant that works in the brain similarly to ketamine.",

They are places where there are fish in the stream and game in the field, and food grows wild; places where our people can live and be Indian.

Choice B is incorrect because, although the passage does say that moving parts can kill wildlife, it does not say that is the most important factor when determining environmental change.

Therefore, they both looked like they had big heads. Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect because a long separation of time could mean that the dinosaurs had evolved in different ways and looked very different. Choice C is incorrect because it shows a way that the dinosaurs looked different rather than a way that they are similar. Both dinosaurs were large, but T. rex would have, in general, been much larger. Choice D is incorrect because it only shows a similarity in diet. It is possible that two carnivores have very different physical characteristics or appearances while still eating the same food.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The conclusion is that M. gigas \"appeared very much like\" T. rex. The text already provides one piece of evidence for this physical similarity: short arms.

Choice A accurately uses information from the graph to explain that one species increased greatly, thus supporting the claim. Distractor Explanation: Choice B is incorrect because it shows stability rather than variability or change. Choice C is incorrect because it is extremely vague and does not show change within the species' composition. It only shows that there is more of one species than another, and those percentages could have remained constant. Choice D is incorrect because it incorrectly says there was a \"decrease\" rather than an \"increase\" in the number of oak trees. There were more 5,000 years ago...which is a more recent time than 10,000 years ago.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The scientist's claim is about \"huge variability\" over time. We need to find the choice that uses the graph's data to show a large change. Let's examine the red maple. 10,000 years ago, it was about 2-3% of the total. 5,000 years ago, it was about 12-13%.

Since the data is related to earnings claims and the percentage of people who actually reached the earnings, then it can be reasonably inferred that differences in environment affects the earnings. Since \"demographic factors\" are differences between parts of the population, those are important to estimate if one person will earn the same amount as other investors. Distractor Explanation: Choice B is not supported by the passage. The earnings claims must include the dates that earnings were achieved, but there is no evidence regarding how often the document is \"updated\" or \"rewritten.\" It is possible that the same document could be used for many years. Choice C is incorrect because, while some sellers may be happy to provide evidence about their claims, there is no indication that \"most\" do not want to give the document to the buyer. Choice D is incorrect because the paragraph says that any sellers of a franchise must provide the document, not every building for sale.",

Therefore, the author implicitly claims that demographic factors can affect a franchise's earnings.",

In other words, the local workers could become \"resentful\" or \"dissatisfied\" because of the difference in wages.

Choice B is incorrect because, while some regions might not benefit immediately from tourism because development money is spent on \"schools or clinics,\" the passage implies that tourism is a good choice for Africa because it creates jobs.

    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The student wants to use the two songs, \"I Got You Babe\" and \"Take Me Home,\" to emphasize a point. Looking at the notes, we see that one song is \"pop/rock\" (1965) and the other is \"disco dance\" (1979). This directly supports the note that \"She was known for regularly changing her... musical styles.\" This option effectively combines these pieces of information to make a clear, synthesized point.",
    "feedback_a": "This choice states the years of the songs, but doesn't connect them to a larger point about Cher's career from the notes.",
    "feedback_b": "This is the correct answer. It synthesizes information from three notes (changing styles, the pop/rock song, the disco song) to make a coherent point that is emphasized by the two specific examples.",
    "feedback_c": "This choice connects her TV series with one of the songs, but the connection is only chronological (they both happened in the 1970s). It doesn't emphasize a broader point about her career.",
    "feedback_d": "This choice connects two unrelated facts (collaborating with her husband for one song, and performing a disco dance song) without a unifying theme to emphasize.",
    "passage_content": "While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: • Cher is a famous musician and performer born in 1946. • She was known for regularly changing her appearance and musical styles. • In the 1970s, she starred in a TV series that ran for 3 years. • She collaborated with her husband on her first pop/rock hit, \"I Got You Babe\" (1965). • Her 1979 disco dance song \"Take Me Home\" brought her fame after a hiatus.",
    "question_stem": "The student wants to emphasize a point using the two songs. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?"
