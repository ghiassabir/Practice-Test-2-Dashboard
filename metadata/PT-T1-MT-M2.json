The value of the discriminant determines the number of solutions for a quadratic equation. Therefore, plugging in the values of a, b, and c into the discriminant, yields: $(-20)^2-4(2)(50)$ which yields $400-400=0$. Therefore, the system will have one solution as the discriminant=0.

    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice B is correct. The slope-intercept equation of a line is $y = mx + b$, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept of the equation. The slope m of a line can be found using the equation $m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$, where $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ represent any two points on the line. Pick two points on the line that are easy to find on the graph. The x and y intercepts of the line are two good points to use. Using points (2,0) and (0,6), the slope of the line can be found by plugging these points into the slope formula, yielding $\\frac{6-0}{0-2}$ or $\\frac{6}{-2} = -3$. The y-intercept of the line is 6. Therefore $y=-3x+6$. All of the answer choices are written in an offset of the standard equation of a line $ax+by=c$. Adding 3x to both sides of the slope-intercept form of the equation gives the standard equation of the line as $3x+y=6$. Multiplying all terms of the equation by 3 to better match the form of the answer choices yields $9x+3y=18$, which matches Choice B. Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect as this equation represents a line with a positive slope. From the graph the slope of the line is negative.

To find the x-intercept of the line represented, the equation of the line first needs to be determined. The slope-intercept form of the equation of the line, $y=mx+b$ is easiest to use. In this equation, m represents the slope of the line and b its y-intercept. The slope of a line can be found using the slope formula $m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$. Plugging in the two points into the slope formula yields $m=\\frac{-3-(-1)}{4-3}=-2$. Therefore the equation of the line is $y=-2x+b$. To find b, plug either point into the equation and solve for b. Using the point (3,-1) yields $-1=-2(3)+b$, $-1=-6+b$, $b=5$. Therefore the equation of the line is $y=-2x+5$. The x-intercept of a line occurs where $y=0$.

We don't know if the students who took the supplement were randomly assigned to that group. There may be confounding variables (e.g., the students who chose to take supplements might also be the ones who study more).\n2.  **Correlation vs. Causation:** The study found a correlation (a relationship) between taking supplements and doing better on exams. However, this does not prove causation. We cannot conclude that the supplements *caused* the improvement.\n3.  **Sample Size and Generalization:** The study was on 20 students from one class. This is a very small sample size, making it difficult to generalize the findings to a larger population (like all third graders).\n4.  **Evaluating the options:**\n    A) This states a general fact, but we can't conclude it from this small, potentially flawed study.\n    B) This makes a definitive statement about students who don't take supplements, which isn't supported. The comparison group just did worse, not necessarily poorly in an absolute sense.\n    C) This claims a cause-and-effect relationship ('improve'), which cannot be established from this study.\n    D) This correctly identifies the key issue. We cannot determine a cause-and-effect relationship due to the lack of a controlled, randomized experiment and the potential for other factors influencing the results.",
