    "correct_answer": "discrimination",
    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice C is the best answer because the underlined word is what goats \"lack\" or \"do not have.\" The first half of the sentence indicates that the goats will eat \"everything else\" as well as \"unwanted weeds.\" In other words, the goat does not care what it eats. Choice C refers to \"judgment,\" or \"refinement\" about what it chooses, so fits the context of eating anything. Distractor Explanation: Choices A and B are incorrect because they refer to unfairness or partiality towards one thing. However, the goats are not deliberately trying to treat one plant poorly; they eat all without preferences. Choice D is incorrect because it refers to an obstinate and unchanging belief about the superiority of one's group over others, but the goats do not feel they are superior to others.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The context describes goats that eat \"everything,\" including both unwanted weeds and other plants. This means they do not differentiate between types of plants. The word that best captures this lack of differentiation or judgment is \"discrimination.\" In this context, \"discrimination\" means the ability to distinguish between things, not its more common social meaning. Since goats eat indiscriminately, they lack discrimination.",
    "feedback_a": "This choice is incorrect. 'Bias' implies a preference for one thing over another. The passage suggests the opposite: goats eat everything without preference.",
    "feedback_b": "This choice is incorrect. 'Prejudice' suggests a preconceived negative opinion, which is a complex human emotion and doesn't fit the context of a goat's eating habits.",
    "feedback_c": "This is the correct answer. In this context, 'discrimination' means the ability to distinguish or make a judgment. The goats eat all plants, showing they lack the ability to discriminate between what they should and shouldn't eat.",
    "feedback_d": "This choice is incorrect. 'Bigotry' refers to extreme, intolerant prejudice, which is far too strong and specific for the context of animal behavior.",
    "passage_content": "Allowing goats to graze an area is one potential solution for removing unwanted weeds in terrain that is too rocky and remote to allow for cutting or herbicide spraying. Goats significantly reduce the incidence of the unwanted plants, but must be quickly removed to prevent them from eating everything else as well: goats lack ______.",

    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice C is the best answer because the underlined word describes how clients and investors view the proposal that the person with a career in business makes. Choice C refers to something that is desirable. The resulting sentence, therefore, indicates that the businessperson helps make the plan desirable to others. Distractor Explanation: None of the other choices adequately shows how the clients and investors need to view the proposals. Choice A refers to a personal quality that inspires others. It does not refer to something inanimate like a proposal. Choice B refers to something that is impossible to avoid the effect of. The clients and investors, though, are not forced to accept the proposal. Choice D refers to something that is extremely interesting so that it is impossible to stop paying attention to it. Although a proposal might be fascinating, the key is to make it desirable enough that others buy into it.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The goal of a business proposal is to persuade clients and investors to accept it. The word needed should describe a proposal that is appealing or desirable. 'Attractive' fits this context perfectly, as it suggests the proposals are made to be appealing and have a high chance of being accepted. The other words are too strong or focus on different qualities.",
    "feedback_a": "This choice is incorrect. 'Charismatic' describes a personal quality of charm and influence. While a charismatic person might make a good proposal, the word itself describes the person, not the proposal.",
    "feedback_b": "This choice is incorrect. 'Irresistible' is too strong. It implies that clients and investors have no choice but to accept, which is an exaggeration. A proposal can be rejected.",
    "feedback_c": "This is the correct answer. 'Attractive' means appealing or desirable. A business professional needs to make proposals that are attractive to clients and investors to persuade them to agree.",
    "feedback_d": "This choice is incorrect. While a proposal might be 'fascinating' (very interesting), the primary goal is to make it appealing enough for acceptance, not just interesting. 'Attractive' better captures the persuasive intent.",

    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice A is the best answer because \"critical\" is the author's view of what \"explaining such coexistence\" is. The sentence continues to say that the explanation is needed to \"truly understand the region's biodiversity.\" Choice A refers to something absolutely necessary, so fits the context in saying that explaining coexistence is necessary to understand biodiversity and therefore developing an appropriate plan for managing the area. Distractor Explanation: None of the other choices accurately describes how essential \"explaining such coexistence\" really is. Choice B means \"dangerous.\" Choice C refers to expressing criticism and disapproval. Choice D refers to using logic and reasoning.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The text states that understanding the coexistence of species is necessary to understand biodiversity and create effective conservation plans. This implies that the explanation is of vital importance. 'Critical' means vitally important or essential, which perfectly fits the context. The explanation is presented as a crucial step for achieving the subsequent goals.",
    "feedback_a": "This is the correct answer. 'Critical' means something is absolutely necessary or of vital importance. The text argues that explaining coexistence is essential for understanding biodiversity and making conservation plans.",
    "feedback_b": "This choice is incorrect. 'Perilous' means dangerous or risky. Explaining coexistence is presented as a necessary task, not a dangerous one.",
    "feedback_c": "This choice is incorrect. 'Condemning' means expressing strong disapproval. The text supports the act of explaining coexistence; it does not condemn it.",
    "feedback_d": "This choice is incorrect. 'Analytica' is not a standard English word. The correct adjective form would be 'analytical,' which means relating to logical reasoning, but 'critical' better captures the sense of necessity described in the text.",
    "passage_content": "Explaining the coexistence of various plant and butterfly species is ______ to truly understand the region's biodiversity and the forces that sustain or reduce it.

Choice B refers to something that is too great to mathematically determine or count. It fits the context that the building's value is so great it cannot be replaced by any money. Distractor Explanations: None of the other choices adequately describe the precious nature of the \"value of the building and its contents.\" Choice A refers to a place or thing that is pleasant and agreeable, not an intangible thing such as \"value.\" Choices C and D refer to something that is physically large or bulky, not something intangible.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The text describes the Hagia Sophia's value by highlighting the \"wealth of splendid and unique details\" added over centuries. This suggests its value is immense and cannot be easily measured. 'Incalculable' means too great to be measured or calculated. This word perfectly describes the immense cultural and historical value of such a significant monument.",
    "feedback_a": "This choice is incorrect. 'Congenial' means pleasant or agreeable, usually describing a person or atmosphere. It does not fit the context of describing historical value.",
    "feedback_b": "This is the correct answer. 'Incalculable' means too great to be calculated or measured. This word effectively conveys the immense and immeasurable historical and cultural value of the Hagia Sophia.",
    "feedback_c": "This choice is incorrect. 'Cumbersome' means large, heavy, and difficult to carry or use. It has a negative connotation and does not describe value.",
    "feedback_d": "This choice is incorrect. 'Voluminous' means occupying a great deal of space, usually used for things like books or clothing. While the Hagia Sophia is large, 'voluminous' does not describe its value.",

    "correct_answer": "To place the results of the Drake Passage study in the wider context of other studies",
    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice C is the best answer because the main point of the paragraph is that \"these results contrast with previous findings\" and emphasize that more studies are needed, indicating that the Drake Passage study did not provide all the answers. Therefore, the paragraph shows how the results of the Drake Passage study fits into \"the wider context\" or \"bigger picture\" of other studies. Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect because the paragraph does not suggest that any of the data gathered so far is \"inaccurate\" or \"not correct.\" Therefore, the paragraph is not being used to show how difficult it is to get correct data. Choice B is incorrect because the paragraph does not \"illustrate\" or \"explain\" why it is hard to \"amass\" or \"gather\" enough data. The paragraph mentions that the conditions are \"challenging,\" but does not give any detail about why. Choice D is incorrect because, though the paragraph says that CO2 absorption is important, it does not talk about \"correcting\" or \"fixing\" the problem. It only says that there needs to be more research done to understand the process better.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The text begins by presenting new findings from the Drake Passage study. It then explicitly states that \"These results contrast with previous findings\" about the Southern Ocean's CO2 sink. The conclusion from the lead investigator emphasizes the need for continued research. The primary function of the text is to present this new, contrasting data and show its significance in the ongoing scientific conversation about the topic. Therefore, its main purpose is to place the new study in the context of previous research.",
    "feedback_a": "While the text mentions a \"challenging environment,\" this is a minor detail. The main focus is on the scientific findings, not the difficulties of data collection.",
    "feedback_b": "This is similar to option A. The text doesn't focus on the problems of amassing data but rather on the results of the data that was successfully amassed.",
    "feedback_c": "This is the correct answer. The text introduces new findings and explicitly contrasts them with previous studies, thereby placing the new results in the broader scientific context.",
    "feedback_d": "The text calls for more measurement, not for correcting the problem of CO2 absorption. The purpose is to understand the phenomenon better, not to propose a solution.",
    "passage_content": "By analyzing more than one million surface ocean observations from the Drake Passage, the researchers detected subtle differences between the CO2 trends in the surface ocean and the atmosphere that suggest a strengthening of the carbon sink that is most pronounced during winter. Although the researchers aren't sure of the exact mechanism driving these changes, it's likely related to winter mixing with deep waters that have not had contact with the atmosphere for several hundred years. These results contrast with previous findings that showed that the Southern Ocean's CO2 sink had been stagnant or weakening from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. \"Given the importance of the Southern Ocean to the global oceans' role in absorbing atmospheric CO2, these studies suggest that we must continue to expand our measurements in this part of the world despite the challenging environment,\" says Colm Sweeney, lead investigator on the Drake Passage study.",

The underlined sentence shows that the garden was large and \"lovely\" or \"appealing,\" and the following sentence gives various reasons that the garden was appealing to all the senses. Distractor Explanation: Choice B is incorrect because there is no contrast with the previous sentence; the garden was lovely, so that provides a reason for the children to want to play there. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence does not refer to \"characters\" or \"people,\" only to place. Choice D is incorrect because there is no \"ominous undercurrent\" or \"scary implication\" in the description of the garden. It could be that the giant is very nice and there is no problem with the children playing there.",

    "option_e": null,
    "correct_answer": "To indicate that the research would apply to overdoses in authentic cases",
    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice B is the best answer because the phrase is used to describe the \"fentanyl analogs\" or \"drugs comparable to fentanyl.\" The fact that they were \"commonly confiscated\" or \"often seized\" by law enforcement shows that the drugs are ones in common use, and therefore are likely to be illegal drugs that overdose patients had access to and used. If this is true, the research on the drugs is likely to \"apply\" or \"be relevant\" to \"authentic cases\" or \"real situations\" in which a patient overdoses on an illegal drug. Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect because the method of \"obtaining\" or \"getting\" the drugs is not mentioned. The researchers could have gotten the drugs from a variety of sources. Choice C is incorrect because the fact that the drugs were the kind seized by officers does not show that the trials were \"improperly\" or \"incorrectly\" done. Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication that the research required special permits to use the drugs. Therefore, the quote is not included to \"establish\" or \"provide a reason\" for a point that is not even mentioned.",

To explore this possibility, a team at Scripps Research Institute led by Kim D. Janda first treated mice with a vaccine that stimulated the animals to produce a slew of different antibodies against fentanyl, some of which helped protect the mice from overdoses. In the new work, the team recovered antibodies from the mice, purified them, and screened them for their ability to bind fentanyl. The team evaluated six of these antibodies against nine fentanyl analogs commonly confiscated by law enforcement. One antibody, 6A4, demonstrated the best fentanyl-binding affinity and had a six-day half-life in mice.",

This is very similar in intent and belief to the statement made by the author of passage 1 that, \"We must have the telescope of philosophy to perceive distant ills.\" Both authors believe that the key to conquering our urge to ignore the suffering of others and make war is consideration and thoughtfulness. Distractor Explanation: Choice B is incorrect because it has no relevance to the underlined concluding message in Text 2.

The passage begins by explaining that the narrator will \"take to the ship\" whenever he is feeling morbid and needs a change. Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that the narrator is a captain. He also does not appear to be a sailor as a steady career, but instead when he feels tired of being on land. Choice C is incorrect because the narrator says he had no money, and therefore felt like going sailing; there is no discussion of a sailor's salary. He could have had a large salary aboard ship but spent it all. Choice D is incorrect because, while the narrator indicates that he was \"impoverished\" with \"little or no money in my purse,\" he does not say how he got to that condition.",

He describes it as a cure for his melancholy (\"driving off the spleen,\" a \"damp, drizzly November in my soul\"). He is not necessarily a professional sailor but someone who seeks the sea as a release. Therefore, the text is a personal reflection on the reasons, or 'impetus,' for embarking on a sea voyage.",

Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.",

    "correct_answer": "A phenomenon that is rarely taken into account when road systems are being planned",

If it were \"taken into consideration\" or \"thought about,\" then planners would probably use a different solution than just building roads. Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect because, although the passage indicates that congestion continues as more roads are built, it does not say that induced demand \"contradicts\" or \"goes against\" that concept. There is also no hint that there is a \"widespread belief\" or \"lots of people thinking\" that building roads causes congestion; if so, the common solution would not be to build more. Choice C is incorrect because there is no hint that city planners are now incorporating the idea into their plans; if so, then there would not be situations like the example from Houston. Choice D is incorrect because there is no discussion in the passage about how to \"mitigate\" or \"reduce\" the effect. The effect is just defined.",

This suggests that induced demand is a factor that planners often overlook when implementing such solutions.",
    "feedback_a": "The text doesn't state what the 'widespread belief' is, so this choice is not supported. The text focuses on defining induced demand and its effects.",
    "feedback_b": "This is the correct answer. The text explains that the 'common solution' to traffic is building more roads, but this often fails due to induced demand, implying this phenomenon is not properly accounted for in planning.",
    "feedback_c": "This contradicts the text. The example of the Katy Freeway suggests that city planners did *not* adequately understand or account for induced demand, leading to a negative outcome.",
    "feedback_d": "The text defines induced demand but does not discuss how it can be mitigated or the effects of educating consumers.",
    "passage_content": "The common solution of building more roads may not have the desired effect of reducing rush-hour traffic. For example, the Katy Freeway project in Houston cost millions of dollars and the upshot was that congestion got worse, with travel times increased by 55% during the evening rush hour and by a third in the mornings. The reason for that is something called \"induced demand,\" a term introduced in the 1960s by economists. It relates to the phenomenon that if more of a good is produced, more is consumed. In the same way, if more roads are provided, more people are encouraged to drive.",

The claim is that \"the poem uses the imagery of fire to delve into the question of who might have created such a dangerous creature.\" In choice B, the words \"furnace\" and \"anvil\" are \"imagery\" or \"symbols\" that evoke heat and fire; they are tools used to heat metal to the melting point and form it into a shape. Choice B refers to \"delving\" or \"asking\" the question of who might have created the \"dangerous creature,\" which causes \"deadly terrors: what furnace, anvil, and grasp could create a tiger? These questions are asking who would dare to forge and hold the tiger. Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect because it touches on the fire imagery in the \"fire of thine eyes,\" but it does not refer to the question of who created such a creature. Choice C is incorrect because it only refers to the creator and the danger or fear caused by a tiger: tigers are scary enough that stars \"throw down their spears\" or \"give up\" and \"water heaven with their tears\" or \"cry.\" Choice C does not use any fire imagery. Choice D also does not give any support to the claim that the poem uses fire imagery; it only wonders if someone who created a lamb could also create a tiger.",

The prompt is asking about a counterargument related to Mother Jones's \"credibility\" or \"believability.\" Mother Jones \"addresses\" or \"faces\" the possible attack that she is not qualified to speak because she is not a miner by saying that she has undergone similar conditions that miners live in and suffer through: \"I was with you nearly three years in this State. I went to jail. I went to the Federal courts.\" Distractor Explanation: Choice B is incorrect because Mother Jones uses her experience in jail as a reason that she can empathize with the miners. It supports her argument of understanding hard conditions rather than weakens her ability to speak for miners. Choice C is incorrect because there is no discussion about how many government contacts she has, so she does not \"anticipate\" a counter argument on that topic.

Stating that the species has only been positively identified on four occasions since its discovery in 1992 powerfully illustrates how rare and elusive it is. This specific, quantifiable fact is much more effective at conveying rarity than the other options.",
    "feedback_a": "This detail is about the discovery process, not the rarity of the animal itself.",
    "feedback_b": "This choice describes the saola's habitat and captivity status, which implies rarity but doesn't emphasize it as directly and powerfully as option C.",
    "feedback_c": "This is the correct answer. Stating that a species has only been seen four times since its discovery is a very direct and effective way to emphasize its extreme rarity.",
    "feedback_d": "This option provides an interesting nickname but does not directly address the question of how rare the animal is.",
    "passage_content": "In May, 1992, the Ministry of Forestry in Vietnam and the World Wildlife Federation jointly conducted a survey and came across an astounding discovery: the first new large mammal species identified in half a century. Called a saola, both the males and females have horns. Almost nothing is known of their behavior, though they are classified as critically endangered.",
    "question_stem": "The writer wants to change the underlined portion to emphasize the rarity of the saola. Which choice most effectively achieves that goal?"
