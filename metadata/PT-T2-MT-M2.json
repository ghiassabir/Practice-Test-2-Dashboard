To solve the quadratic equation use either the factor method or the quadratic formula. Using the factor method, get the two factors of $18x^2$ whose sum is $-11x$. The two factors are $-2x$ and $-9x$ which makes the equation $2x^2 - 2x - 9x + 9 = 0$. Grouping the first two terms together and the last two terms together yields $(2x^2 - 2x) - (9x - 9) = 0$.

We need two numbers that multiply to $(2)(9)=18$ and add to $-11$. These numbers are $-2$ and $-9$. We rewrite the middle term: $2x^2 - 2x - 9x + 9 = 0$.

Take half of the coefficient of x (which is 6), square it ($3^2=9$), and add it to both sides. For y: $y^2 - 4y$.
