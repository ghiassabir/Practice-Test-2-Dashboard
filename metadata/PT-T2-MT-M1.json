    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice A is correct. She burns 20 calories when she walks every minute. Therefore, she burned 20x calories after x minutes. She also burns 35 calories every minute she cycles and therefore burns 35y calories after y minutes. The equation would therefore be $20x + 35y = 340$. Subtracting 20x from both sides of this equation yields $35y = 340 - 20x$. Distractor Explanation: Choice B is incorrect because it states that the difference between the calories burned from cycling and burned from walking is equal to 340. Choice C and Choice D are incorrect. The rate of 20 calories per minute can only be multiplied by x minutes of walking. And the rate of 35 calories per minute can only be multiplied by y minutes of cycling.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "To translate the word problem into an equation, we need to account for the calories burned from both activities. The total calories burned is the sum of calories from walking and cycling.\n1. Calories from walking: Ash walks for $x$ minutes and burns 20 calories per minute, so the total calories from walking is $20x$.\n2. Calories from cycling: Ash cycles for $y$ minutes and burns 35 calories per minute, so the total calories from cycling is $35y$.\n3. Total calories: The sum of the calories from both activities is 340. So, the equation is $20x + 35y = 340$.\nThe question asks for an equation that represents the routine, and the options are rearranged forms of this equation. To match option A, we can isolate the $35y$ term by subtracting $20x$ from both sides: $35y = 340 - 20x$. This matches option A exactly.",
    "feedback_a": "This is the correct answer. The total calories burned, $20x + 35y$, equals 340. Rearranging this equation by subtracting $20x$ from both sides gives $35y = 340 - 20x$.",

Converting $81^{-x}$ to a base 3 yields $(3^4)^{-x}$ or $3^{-4x}$. The equation will now become $3^{3x} / 3^{-4x} = 3^{ax}$. On the right side of the equation, the bases are divided, which means that the exponents must be subtracted. Subtracting the exponents yields $3^{(3x - (-4x))} = 3^{ax}$ or simply $3^{7x} = 3^{ax}$. Equating the exponents yields $7x = ax$. Dividing both sides of the equation by x yields $7 = a$.",

Rewrite 27 and 81 as powers of 3:\n    - $27 = 3^3$\n    - $81 = 3^4$\n2.  Substitute these into the equation:\n    $\\frac{(3^3)^x}{(3^4)^{-x}} = 3^{ax}$\n3.

    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice B is correct. The general equation of a parabola is given by $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ denotes the coordinate of the vertex. In this case, $h = 3$ and $k = 10$. Thus, the equation becomes $y = a(x-3)^2 + 10$. The sign of a denotes the orientation of the parabola. If a is positive, the parabola opens upward. If a is negative, the parabola opens downward. In this case, the parabola opens downward so the value of a must be negative. Therefore, the equation of the parabola is $y = -2(x - 3)^2 + 10$. Distractor Explanation: Choice A and Choice C are incorrect since their a is positive which would suggest that the graph opens upwards however the graph opens downwards. Choice D is incorrect and may result from using $(-3, 10)$ as the vertex instead of $(3, 10)$.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The equation of a parabola in vertex form is $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex.\n1.  **Identify the vertex:** From the graph, the vertex (the highest point) of the parabola is at $(3, 10)$. So, $h=3$ and $k=10$. This means the equation has the form $y = a(x-3)^2 + 10$. This eliminates options A and D, which have a vertex at $(-3, 10)$.\n2.  **Determine the sign of 'a':** The parabola opens downwards, which means the coefficient 'a' must be negative. This eliminates option C, which has a positive $a$ ($a=2$).\n3.  **Confirm the correct option:** Option B is $y = -2(x - 3)^2 + 10$. This equation has a vertex at $(3, 10)$ and a negative 'a' value ($a=-2$), which means it opens downwards. This matches the graph. We could further verify by testing a point, for example, the graph appears to pass through $(2, 8)$. Let's check: $y = -2(2 - 3)^2 + 10 = -2(-1)^2 + 10 = -2(1) + 10 = 8$.
