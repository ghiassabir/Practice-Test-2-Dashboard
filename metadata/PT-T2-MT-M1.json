    "explanation_original": "Choice C is the best answer because in the sentence, the underlined word is what beach resorts create. Choice C refers to the trait of being attractive and interesting enough to entice people to come. It fits the context of saying that even if there were no other tourist destinations, beach resorts are very attractive and interesting to tourists.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The question asks for the most logical and precise word to complete the sentence about beach resorts. The context describes Africa's potential to attract tourists, with beach resorts being a key factor. The word needed should describe this power of attraction. 'Draw' means an attraction or enticement. Beach resorts serve as a significant 'draw' for tourists, which aligns perfectly with the text's focus on attracting visitors. The other options are not suitable. 'Haul' implies forceful pulling. 'Persuasion' is an act of reasoning, not an inherent quality of a place. 'Connection' is too general and doesn't capture the specific meaning of attraction.",
    "feedback_a": "This option is incorrect. 'Haul' means to pull or drag something with force and effort. It does not fit the context of attracting tourists, which is a voluntary action.",
    "feedback_b": "This option is incorrect. 'Persuasion' is the act of convincing someone through argument or reasoning. A beach resort's appeal is an inherent quality, not an act of persuasion.",
    "feedback_c": "This is the correct answer. A 'draw' is something that attracts people. The text emphasizes the potential to attract tourists, and the beautiful beach resorts serve as a major attraction, or 'draw'.",
    "feedback_d": "This option is incorrect. While tourists might feel a 'connection' to a place, the word 'draw' more accurately describes the active role the resort plays in attracting them in the first place.",
    "passage_content": "Tourism is a growing sector of the global economy. Travel and tourism jobs are increasing worldwide, but Africa as a whole attracts less than 5 percent of total world tourists.

The blank needs an adjective that describes the painter named Johannes Vermeer. \"Eminent\" refers to someone or something famous in a given field. In this context, it shows that the painter Johannes Vermeer is well-known in the field of art.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "This question asks for the best adjective to describe the painter Johannes Vermeer. The text mentions John Montias's studies led to 'breakthroughs' in understanding Vermeer. This implies Vermeer is a significant and respected figure in his field. The word 'eminent' means famous, respected, or distinguished within a particular sphere. This perfectly describes a historical artist of Vermeer's stature. The other words do not fit. 'Conspicuous' means easily seen or obvious. 'Radiant' means shining or glowing brightly. 'Absolute' means complete or not modified. None of these accurately describe a person's professional standing.",
    "feedback_a": "This option is incorrect. 'Conspicuous' means standing out so as to be clearly visible. While a famous artist's work might be conspicuous, the word itself doesn't convey the sense of respect and distinction required here.",

Therefore, as used in the last sentence of the passage, \"facile\" refers to a superficial or shallow imitation of Marlowe's style of writing.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The question asks for the meaning of 'facile' as used in the text. The author describes the writer of the additions as a 'clever and facile imitator.' However, the preceding sentence casts doubt on the quality of these additions, noting they are 'often ingenious, and sometimes, they are improvements.' The 'sometimes' suggests the improvements are not consistent. A 'facile' imitation, in this critical context, implies something done with ease but lacking depth or originality. Therefore, 'superficial' is the best fit, suggesting a shallow imitation that mimics the style without capturing the substance. 'Accomplished' and 'successful' are too positive, which is contradicted by the text's lukewarm assessment. 'Effortless' focuses only on the ease, but misses the negative connotation of shallowness implied by the context.",
    "feedback_a": "This option is incorrect. 'Accomplished' implies a high degree of skill and quality, which contradicts the text's statement that the additions are only 'sometimes' improvements.",
    "feedback_b": "This option is incorrect. 'Successful' is too positive. The author's tone is doubtful, suggesting the imitation was not entirely successful in capturing the quality of Marlowe's original work.",
    "feedback_c": "This option is incorrect. While 'facile' can mean effortless, in this context, it carries a negative connotation. The author implies the imitation is clever but lacks depth, making 'superficial' a better choice than the more neutral 'effortless'.",
    "feedback_d": "This is the correct answer. The text suggests the imitation is clever but not always an improvement, implying it lacks the depth of the original. 'Superficial' accurately captures this sense of being easily achieved but lacking in substance.",

That detail can eliminate the weakness that the horses already knew the people and were reacting according to their experiences rather than that they were identifying an emotion from a picture of a face.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The question asks about the function of the underlined sentence: 'The people in the photographs were all strangers to the horses.' The text describes an experiment testing if horses can recognize human emotions in photos. A potential flaw in this experiment would be if the horses already knew the people and were reacting based on past experiences with them, not the photos. By stating the people were strangers, the author preemptively addresses and dismisses this potential criticism. This strengthens the study's conclusion that the horses were indeed reacting to the emotions displayed in the photos. Therefore, the sentence's purpose is to eliminate a possible weakness in the study's design.",
    "feedback_a": "This option is incorrect. The sentence specifies a characteristic of the subjects (that they were strangers), but it doesn't explain the process or criteria for how they were chosen for the experiment.",
    "feedback_b": "This option is incorrect. The sentence states the people were strangers, but this single detail doesn't support a broader conclusion that horses have a limited range of human contacts. In fact, the experiment's premise is about their ability to process human emotions.",
    "feedback_c": "This option is incorrect. While the entire passage is about expression and communication, the specific purpose of this underlined sentence is methodological—it's about the design of the experiment, not the theme of communication itself.",
    "feedback_d": "This is the correct answer. The sentence clarifies that the horses had no prior relationship with the people in the photos. This is a crucial detail of the experimental design, as it rules out the possibility that the horses' reactions were based on previous interactions rather than the emotions in the images.",
    "passage_content": "Horses have been demonstrated to possess complex thought processes that involve associations, memories, and recognition of emotions in other species. For example, in one experiment, horses were shown photographs of human faces that were angry or happy. The people in the photographs were all strangers to the horses.

The same is true for his discussion of organic compounds in Martian soil, a giant cloud of space alcohol, and the discovery of thousands of habitable planets.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The question asks what rhetorical technique the author uses. The author builds an argument that the building blocks of life are common in the universe. To support this, the text lists a series of discoveries: amino acids in comets, organic compounds on Mars, a giant cloud of space alcohol, and thousands of catalogued exoplanets. Each of these is a result, or 'finding,' from scientific research and observation. The author is summarizing these findings to support the main idea. The text does not use personal stories (anecdotes), comparisons (analogies), or unsupported claims (unsubstantiated theories).",

Complex organic chemistry is surprisingly common. Amino acids, just like those that make up every protein in our bodies, have been found in the tails of comets. There are other organic compounds in Martian soil. And 6,500 light years away a giant cloud of space alcohol floats among the stars. Habitable planets seem to be common too.

The Sutton-Boveri theory is \"that genes were located in specific places on the chromosomes.\" The passage says that Morgan \"criticized the theory\" at first or was \"initially skeptical,\" but \"after careful documentation,\" determined that certain genes are located on the X chromosome, showing that he had changed his mind and thought that there were indeed at least some genes in specific places on chromosomes.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The question asks how Thomas Hunt Morgan (Text 2) would likely view the theory of Sutton and Boveri (Text 1) after his own experiments. Text 2 states that Morgan initially 'criticized' the theory. However, his own research on fruit flies led him to conclude 'that eye color genes were located on the X chromosome.' This conclusion directly supports Sutton and Boveri's general theory that genes are located on chromosomes. Therefore, despite his initial skepticism, Morgan's own findings would lead him to accept the theory as likely true. Option D captures this journey from skepticism to validation.",
    "feedback_a": "This option is incorrect. Morgan's finding was a major confirmation, not a 'minor detail.' His work helped solidify the chromosome theory, rather than just adjusting it.",
    "feedback_b": "This option is incorrect. Morgan's data did not contradict the theory; it strongly supported it by providing specific evidence for a gene on a particular chromosome.",
    "feedback_c": "This option is incorrect. Morgan's work provided the very 'scientific findings' that supported the theory, moving it from 'plausible' to experimentally supported.",

In the late 1880s, scientists finally could stain cell structures with the clarity to see chromosomes. Walter Sutton and Theodor Boveri, in 1902 and 1903 respectively, independently published papers suggesting that genes were located in specific places on the chromosomes, which came in matched pairs except for the male Y chromosome.\n\nText 2\nThomas Hunt Morgan criticized the Sutton-Boveri chromosome theory of inheritance. However, he noticed some unusual trends while conducting experiments on fruit flies. A few males had white rather than red eyes, so he bred them and observed the results. He determined that white was a recessive mutation which did not appear in any first-generation females, though it might resurface in subsequent generations. After careful documentation, he published his conclusion that eye color genes were located on the X chromosome.",

    "explanation_original": "Choice C is the best answer because \"any opiate\" would include both users of prescription opiates and users of non-prescription opiates. In Figure 1, any opiate refers to the combination of the bottom and middle sections of the column. The right-hand column for 2017 has a combined amount of about 48,000 deaths, since the second section of the bar reaches to just under the 50,000 line.",

The text discusses treating 'opioid overdose,' which encompasses all types of opioids. The graph for 2017 shows three categories: 'prescription opioids' (bottom segment), 'other opioids' (middle segment), and 'non-opioids drugs' (top segment). To find the total deaths from 'any opiate,' we must add the 'prescription opioids' and 'other opioids' segments. Looking at the 2017 bar, the 'prescription opioids' bar ends around 18,000. The 'other opioids' segment ends just under 50,000. Thus, the total for any opiate is approximately 48,000. Option C provides this value.",

    "feedback_d": "This option is incorrect. 75,000 is an overestimation of the total number of deaths from all drug types combined in 2017, which is approximately 72,000. It is certainly not the total for prescription opiates alone.",
