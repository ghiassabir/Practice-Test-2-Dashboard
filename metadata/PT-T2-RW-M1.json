    "explanation_original": "Choice C is the best answer because the blank portion shows how hyraxes resemble guinea pigs. Choice C refers to something that is only on the outside or surface, so fits the context of saying that the hyrax and guinea pig look similar, but they are not really related. Distractor Explanations: None of the other choices accurately explain how hyraxes resemble guinea pigs. Choice A refers to something that makes sense through reasoning, but one would reason that if the hyrax is related to an elephant, then it should look more like one. Choice B refers to something that happens by habit or tradition, but appearance is not based on habit. Choice D refers to something that happens in all cases or everywhere, so does not establish that some people see a general similarity.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The text presents a contrast between how hyraxes appear and what they are related to genetically. They 'resemble' guinea pigs, but this is only an outward appearance, not a reflection of their true biological lineage. The word 'superficially' means 'on the surface' or 'as to outward appearance only,' which perfectly captures this intended meaning of a misleading resemblance.",
    "feedback_a": "This option is incorrect. 'Logically' implies a connection based on reason. The text highlights a disconnect between appearance and reality, which is the opposite of a logical connection.",
    "feedback_b": "This option is incorrect. 'Customarily' relates to habits or traditions. The physical resemblance of an animal is a matter of biology, not custom.",
    "feedback_c": "This is the correct answer. The text describes a situation where the outward appearance (resembling guinea pigs) is misleading when compared to the underlying reality (related to sea cows). 'Superficially' precisely means 'on the surface,' fitting the context perfectly.",
    "feedback_d": "This option is incorrect. 'Universally' means 'in all cases' or 'everywhere.' The text is making a specific point about the nature of the resemblance, not its widespread acceptance.",
    "passage_content": "Hyraxes are small, furry, herbivorous mammals with short tails that live primarily in Africa; one species is also found in the Middle East.

Choice D means \"\"blocked\"\" or \"\"prevented,\"\" which fits the context of showing that events prevented the goals of the IRA from being completely fulfilled; that is why it is still needed today. Distractor Explanation: Choices A and C can be eliminated because they are emotional responses, but \"\"the purposes of the IRA\"\" are inanimate and cannot experience emotions. Choice A means \"\"irritated\"\" and Choice D means \"\"not happy with something.\"\" Choice B is incorrect because \"\"fulfilling\"\" refers to something doing the act of making another thing happen. However, it does not fit the context because World War II and the termination era were not things that could \"\"fulfill\"\" or make the IRA's goals happen. They were obstacles that stopped other things from fulfilling the purposes of the IRA.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The text describes how historical events acted as obstacles to the goals of the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA). The word 'frustrated' in this context means that the purposes of the act were actively blocked or prevented from being achieved. 'Thwarted' means to prevent (someone) from accomplishing something, which is the best synonym in this context.",
    "feedback_a": "This option is incorrect. 'Annoyed' is a human emotion. An abstract concept like 'the purposes of the IRA' cannot feel annoyed.",
    "feedback_b": "This option is incorrect. While the purposes were indeed unfulfilled, 'frustrated' implies an active force causing this state. 'Thwarted' better captures the idea of being actively blocked by the obstacles mentioned (WWII and the termination era).",

Distractor Explanation: None of the other choices adequately shows what is guaranteed by the Constitution. Choice A refers to the process of sharing something. Choice B refers to plans or preparations, but does not include the idea that they must occur. Choice C is a future event that might occur but cannot be accurately predicted.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "In this context, the text refers to 'freedom of speech, a provision guaranteed by the Constitution.' A 'provision' in a legal or formal document is a condition, stipulation, or requirement. The Constitution stipulates that freedom of speech is a fundamental right. Therefore, 'requirement' is the best synonym, as it captures the sense of something that is formally established and necessary.",

    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice C is the best answer. The underlined sentence says that Sara flushed, which typically happens in anger or embarrassment. In this context, she appears embarrassed because she is not old or experienced enough—and was too \"\"punctilious\"\" or \"\"careful\"\"—to explain how she felt in a few words. The fact that she flushes highlights her sense of awkwardness and embarrassment. Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect because the sentence only says that Sara flushed. It does not explain what she looked like; she could be tall, short, dark-haired or blonde, dressed nicely, etc. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence only establishes that Sara blushes. It does not give a reason why; the following sentences show she could speak French but was reluctant to tell Miss Minchin so. Choice D is incorrect because there is no interaction between characters in the following sentences. The underlined portion is expanded upon with a reason for blushing, not actions.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The sentence preceding the underlined portion explains Sara's internal conflict and hesitation. The underlined sentence, 'But, as it was, she felt a flush rising on her cheeks,' describes a physical reaction (blushing) that is a direct result of this emotional state of discomfort and embarrassment.

    "feedback_a": "This option is incorrect. A 'flush rising on her cheeks' is a temporary physical reaction, not a permanent part of her physical appearance like hair or eye color.",

    "correct_answer": "It is important to obey orders from a superior officer aboard a ship.",
    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice D is the best answer because the narrator describes his actions on the boat, \"\"jumping from spar to spar\"\" as similar to the jumping of a grasshopper. This work is because \"\"they rather order me about some\"\"; presumably \"\"they\"\" are the officers that are not \"\"simple sailors.\"\" He says that it is true that he has to hop around obeying orders, but says that \"\"at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough\"\" but that \"\"this wears off in time.\"\" Therefore, the analogy \"\"anticipates\"\" or \"\"defends against\"\" the argument that such work is \"\"distasteful\"\" or \"\"unpleasant\"\" because he says he is used to the role. Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect because \"\"compensations\"\" refers to payment, but the text does not contain references to money. Choice B is incorrect because the question is asking for an argument that the grasshopper analogy is used to disprove. Since the grasshopper analogy is that sailors are hopping around, or busy, the argument being disproved should be the opposite, that sailors are not busy. Choice C is incorrect because the analogy of the grasshopper does not show that it is necessary or not to obey orders; the narrator merely says he does and that it is distasteful at first but he gets used to it.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The narrator likens his own actions—being ordered about and jumping 'from spar to spar'—to a grasshopper. This description directly illustrates the nature of his work, which involves active, sometimes frantic, obedience to orders from superiors. By using this analogy, he anticipates and implicitly confirms the argument that obeying orders is a key part of his life as a 'simple sailor,' even if it is 'unpleasant at first'.",
    "feedback_a": "This option is incorrect. The text does not mention payment or compensation in any way.",
    "feedback_b": "This option is incorrect. The analogy of the grasshopper illustrates the *nature* of the sailor's duties (being ordered about), not the amount of time they take up.",

I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. But this wears off in time.

    "option_e": null,
    "correct_answer": "It indicates that Adam Patch was living in the past rather than the present.",
    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice A is the best answer because the phrase implies that Adam Patch still felt he was living in 1861, whereas really years had passed the times were changing. The phrase gives a reason for him to \"\"weary\"\" and become tired... he had been so wrapped up in reforms, but his causes were not current or relevant any more. His thoughts were still focused on events such as the Civil War rather than on everyday life or his grandson. Distractor Explanation: Choice B is incorrect because the passage implies that Adam focused on things that interested him. The fact that the wife and son died in the past is not the reason that he thinks about them infrequently; he doesn't really care about them as much as he does about things that happened earlier, like the Civil War. Choice C is incorrect because the fact that the times changed was the reason that his campaign against vices started to fade. The changing times is not why he started to fight against vice. Choice D is incorrect because someone can be interesting even if the times change. The reason that Adam was a bore was his actions during that time.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The underlined portion, '1861 was creeping up slowly on 1895,' creates a surreal sense of time. In reality, 1895 is the later year. This reversal suggests that for Adam Patch, the past (1861, the start of the Civil War) is more present and real than the actual present (1895). This functions to show that he is mentally and emotionally stuck in the past, disconnected from his current reality.",
    "feedback_a": "This is the correct answer. The phrase '1861 was creeping up slowly on 1895' is a deliberately strange construction that shows Adam's mind is fixated on the past (the Civil War era) rather than the present.",
    "feedback_b": "This option is incorrect. The text states he thought 'somewhat' of his dead wife and son, but the reason for his infrequent reflection isn't provided by this phrase; rather, it highlights his greater obsession with the Civil War.",
    "feedback_c": "This option is incorrect. The text states he started his campaign *before* this period of weariness. This phrase helps explain why he was 'wearying'—his concerns were outdated—not why he started the campaign in the first place.",
    "feedback_d": "This option is incorrect. While his obsession with the past might contribute to him being a bore, the primary function of this specific, time-distorting phrase is to show his disconnection from the present.",
    "passage_content": "The following text is adapted from F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1922 novel, \"\"The Beautiful and the Damned.\"\" At fifty-seven years old Adam Patch determined, after a severe attack of sclerosis, to consecrate the remainder of his life to the moral regeneration of the world. He became a reformer among reformers. He levelled a varied assortment of uppercuts and body-blows at liquor, literature, vice, art, patent medicines, and Sunday theatres. From an armchair in the office of his Tarrytown estate he directed against the enormous hypothetical enemy, unrighteousness, a campaign which went on through fifteen years, during which he displayed himself a rabid monomaniac, an unqualified nuisance, and an intolerable bore. The year in which this story opens found him wearying; 1861 was creeping up slowly on 1895; his thoughts ran a great deal on the Civil War, somewhat on his dead wife and son, almost infinitesimally on his grandson Anthony.",

Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not say that naloxone has \"\"no results\"\" for some drugs. It only claims that it is less effective, meaning it has results that are not as strong, for \"\"powerful synthetic opioids like fentanyl and carfentanil.\"\" Choice D is incorrect because there is no evidence of side effects related to naloxone. The only negative effect implied is that it needs to be readministered because it wears off quickly.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The passage explicitly states that 'naloxone breaks down after about an hour, which allows a relapse into overdose unless the drug is re-administered.' This directly points to the temporary nature of its effectiveness as its main drawback. Its 'short lifetime' is the key reason it is not a perfect solution.",
    "feedback_a": "This is the correct answer. The text's central criticism of naloxone is that it 'breaks down after about an hour,' meaning its protective effect is short-lived.",

The fast-acting treatment, sold as Narcan, races towards the brain where it blocks opioid receptors, denying the drugs access to them. But naloxone breaks down after about an hour, which allows a relapse into overdose unless the drug is re-administered. Naloxone's short lifetime also makes it less effective against powerful synthetic opioids like fentanyl and carfentanil, which are 100- and 10,000-fold stronger than morphine, respectively.

The reader has presumably seen a rainbow, however, so that image might help the reader visualize light bending when it hits the atmosphere as being similar to light bending when it hits rain. Distractor Explanations: Choice A is incorrect because \"\"originate\"\" means \"\"begin,\"\" but light does not begin in a rainbow. Choice C is incorrect because the example of the rainbow shows the rule or effect of Rayleigh Scattering, it is not an \"\"exception\"\" or \"\"not part of\"\" the rule. Choice D is incorrect because the idea of a rainbow does not tell the reader \"\"why\"\" or \"\"the reason\"\" blue scatters more easily; a rainbow just offers an image which shows that colors separate in different ways when they hit something like rain or the atmosphere.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The author is explaining Rayleigh Scattering, a potentially complex scientific concept. By mentioning a rainbow, the author connects this concept to a common, easily visualized phenomenon that demonstrates a similar principle (light splitting and scattering).

    "feedback_b": "This is the correct answer. The author introduces a scientific concept (Rayleigh Scattering) and immediately connects it to a rainbow, a phenomenon most readers have seen and can easily picture. This makes the abstract concept more concrete.",
    "feedback_c": "This option is incorrect. The rainbow is used as an example *of* the rule of light scattering, not as an exception to it.",

    "passage_content": null,
    "question_stem": "Why does the sky turn red at sunrise and sunset? The reason is Rayleigh Scattering, which is actually the same effect that you see in a rainbow when light hits rain. Light travels in waves, with red waves being the longest visible light and blue being the shortest. The shorter the wave, the easier it scatters into different directions. During the day, the Sun shines directly down on the atmosphere, so all wavelengths enter and the sky looks blue to a viewer. However, when the Sun gets lower on the horizon, the light is traveling through a much larger distance of the atmosphere to reach the same place on the Earth's surface. At that angle, many of the shorter blue waves get scattered into outer space, and only the longer, red waves, which travel in a straighter line before being scattered, reach the viewer. Why does the author mention a rainbow in the text?"

    "option_a": "They show that the girl's true age belied her outward appearance.",
    "option_b": "They establish that the girl was not suitably clad for the weather.",
    "option_c": "They identify the reason for the narrator's interest in the girl.",
    "option_d": "They highlight a contrast between the girl's appearance and her actions.",
    "option_e": null,
    "correct_answer": "They highlight a contrast between the girl's appearance and her actions.",
    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice D is the best answer because the words \"\"charming\"\" and \"\"jaunty\"\" are often associated with cute, fun things. They imply that the yellow hat and black mantle were sweet or endearing things that a happy young girl might wear, for example, to a party. However, the girl is crying on a canal railing, so her cheerful clothes form a \"\"contrast\"\" or \"\"opposite\"\" impression. Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect because the passage indicates that the girl is relatively young; the narrator starts by calling her a \"\"woman\"\" and shifts to \"\"girl\"\" after he gets a closer look. Clothes described as \"\"charming\"\" and \"\"jaunty\"\" are suitable for a younger person, so do not \"\"belie\"\" or \"\"contradict\"\" that she is young. Choice B is not supported by the passage because there is no description of the temperature or that her clothing was inappropriate; for example, she was not shivering because she was too cold. Choice C is incorrect because the narrator noticed the woman's action of leaning on a railing before noting her appearance. Her clothing is described as he takes a closer look.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The words 'charming' and 'jaunty' describe the girl's clothing in a way that suggests a lighthearted, happy, or stylish mood. However, the narrator is then 'taken aback' to discover she is 'sobbing uncontrollably.' The function of these descriptive words is to set up a cheerful image of her appearance which then contrasts sharply with the deep sorrow of her actions.",
    "feedback_a": "This option is incorrect. 'Charming' and 'jaunty' are suitable for a young person, which aligns with the narrator's conclusion that she is a 'girl.' They don't contradict her age.",
    "feedback_b": "This option is incorrect. The text provides no information about the weather, so it's impossible to determine if her clothing was suitable.",
    "feedback_c": "This option is incorrect. The narrator's interest is sparked by seeing her on the canal railing *before* he describes her clothes. His interest leads him to notice the clothes, not the other way around.",
    "feedback_d": "This is the correct answer. Her 'charming' and 'jaunty' attire suggests happiness and liveliness, which is in direct contrast to her action of 'sobbing uncontrollably.' This highlights the surprising and poignant disconnect between her appearance and her emotional state.",
    "passage_content": null,
    "question_stem": "The following text is adapted from Fyodor Dostoevsky's 1848 collection of stories, \"\"White Nights and Other Stories.\"\" Leaning on the canal railing stood a woman with her elbows on the rail, she was apparently looking with great attention at the muddy water of the canal. She was wearing a very charming yellow hat and a jaunty little black mantle. \"\"She's a girl, and I am sure she is dark,\"\" I thought. She did not seem to hear my footsteps, and did not even stir when I passed by with bated breath and loudly throbbing heart. I was taken aback when I realized she was not just gazing at the water, but sobbing uncontrollably. In the text, what is the main function of the words \"\"charming\"\" and \"\"jaunty\"\"?"

    "option_e": null,
    "correct_answer": "A farmer trades several chickens for enough wood to build a house for his newly-married son.",
    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice A is the best answer because the passage defines the informal sector of the economy as \"\"that which is not regulated, controlled, or taxed.\"\" Therefore, a situation where goods are bartered between people would count as \"\"informal\"\" because there is no money changing hands and no taxes paid on the exchange. Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect because the projects sponsored by a foreign investor would most likely need to go through an approval process and the school would need to pass at least a basic inspection. Choice A would include regulations and controls, so would be considered formal. Choice C is incorrect because, while it might not be completely honest, there would still need to be nominal proof about how much tax money was spent and what it was used for. Choice D is weak because there is no evidence in the example to elaborate on the young man's situation. For example, he could have filed all the correct paperwork, moved into a new apartment, and been paying income taxes from his new salary.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The text defines the informal sector as that which is 'not regulated, controlled, or taxed.' A barter transaction, where goods (chickens) are exchanged directly for other goods (wood) without any money changing hands, is a classic example of an unregulated and untaxed economic activity. This perfectly illustrates the concept as described.",
    "feedback_a": "This is the correct answer. This is a barter trade. No money is exchanged, and no taxes can be collected. This fits the definition of an informal transaction that is not regulated, controlled, or taxed.",
    "feedback_b": "This option is incorrect. A large-scale project by an international corporation would almost certainly be subject to government regulations, permits, and controls, placing it in the formal sector.",
    "feedback_c": "This option is incorrect. The use of tax money is, by definition, part of the formal, regulated economy. While potentially corrupt, the transaction itself uses official government funds.",
    "feedback_d": "This option is incorrect. This describes migration, not an economic transaction. While the young man may end up working in the informal sector, the act of moving itself is not an illustration of a transaction within it.",
    "passage_content": null,
    "question_stem": "Most of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa works in subsistence agriculture to make a living and feed their typically large families. In recent decades, there has been enormous rural-to-urban migration to the major cities, which are extremely overcrowded. At the center of the main business districts are modern high-rise business offices well connected to the global economy, but outside are slums with no services and miserable, unsanitary conditions. The informal sector of the economy—that which is not regulated, controlled, or taxed—has become the primary system of doing business. The lack of government regulation prevents taxes from being assessed or collected, which, in turn, diminishes support for public services or infrastructure. Based on information from the text, which of the following would best illustrate a transaction that occurs in the informal sector of the Sub-Saharan economy?"

    "option_a": "Ridership in Washington, DC, increased from just over 2 percent in 2010 to 4 percent in 2015.",
    "option_b": "Washington, DC, used to have lower ridership than any other of the top five cities for bicycle commuters in 2010.",

    "option_e": null,
    "correct_answer": "Ridership in Washington, DC, increased from just over 2 percent in 2010 to 4 percent in 2015.",
    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice A is the best answer. The claim is that \"\"such programs\"\" are successful. There are two programs listed, making cycling safer and making bikes accessible. There are no specific examples of increasing safety, but the passage describes the details making bikes accessible by adding bike share depots in DC. Choice A shows that the program in DC, which started in 2010, probably has strong results, as ridership increased by over a percent in the five years after that policy was started. Distractor Explanation: Choice B is incorrect because it only says that DC had low ridership, but there is no indication of change. The reader does not know that the ridership increased after the program started. Choice C is incorrect because it focuses on Portland, but there is no indication that Portland did anything to make cycling safer or more accessible. Choice C also refers to DC, but the percentage of commuters is lower than that of Portland, so it could appear that the program was not very successful. Choice D is incorrect because the reader does not know whether the program helped make the number of commuters in DC greater. It is possible that all along, there have been more commuters than the other cities. It is even possible that ridership in DC decreased after the program started.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The text explicitly mentions the program in Washington, DC, which added bike share depots since 2010, as an example of making bikes more accessible. To show the 'success' of this specific program, the most effective data would show a positive change in ridership in DC after 2010. The graph shows that in 2010 (light bar), DC ridership was just over 2%. In 2015 (dark bar), it was 4%. This data directly supports the success of the DC program mentioned.",
    "feedback_a": "This is the correct answer. The text uses Washington, DC, as an example of a city that implemented a program to make biking more accessible starting in 2010. This choice provides the specific data from the graph (increase from ~2% to 4% between 2010 and 2015) that proves the success of that program.",
    "feedback_b": "This option is incorrect. While true according to the graph, simply stating that DC had low ridership in 2010 does not provide evidence that the program implemented *since* 2010 was successful. It doesn't show change.",
    "feedback_c": "This option is incorrect. Comparing DC's final percentage to Portland's undermines the argument about DC's success, as Portland's is higher. The most effective choice will focus only on the data relevant to the specific example given: Washington, DC.",
    "feedback_d": "This option is incorrect. The graph does not provide enough information to determine the absolute number of commuters, only the percentage. Furthermore, it shows that in 2015, DC's percentage (4%) was lower than Portland's (over 6%).",
    "passage_content": "Based on data from the US Census Bureau Why do people ride bicycles to work? Weather is not everything, as there is an annual average of 156 days of rain in the top commuting city, Portland, Oregon. Making cycling safer by adding protected bike lanes can increase ridership. Another option is making bikes more accessible, such as was done in the District of Columbia, which added 400 bike share depots since 2010. The success of such programs is evident: _________",

    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice D is correct because it shows an example of the inconsistent growth between the years 2020 to 2022. The previous sentence in the text talks about how the customer preference for electric cars has not increased uniformly. Choice D further illustrates this idea. Distractor Explanation: All the other choices are incorrect because the text must be completed with an example that illustrates the uneven rise in customer preference for battery-electric cars. Choices A and B both only state the number of electric cars registered between 2016-2019 and 2020, respectively. Choice C is incorrect because it does not offer a comparison that shows an uneven increase.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The text claims that the increase in electric car preference has 'not increased uniformly.' To support this, we need data showing an uneven or inconsistent rate of growth. Let's analyze the graph: The increase from 2020 (approx. 200k) to 2021 (approx. 400k) is about 200,000. The increase from 2021 (approx. 400k) to 2022 (approx. 700k) is about 300,000. Comparing these two yearly increases (200k vs 300k) demonstrates the non-uniform growth perfectly.",
    "feedback_a": "This option is incorrect. This statement is a simple fact from the graph but does not show a comparison between different periods, which is necessary to demonstrate non-uniform growth.",
    "feedback_b": "This option is incorrect. Like option A, this is a static fact from one point in time and does not illustrate the *rate* of increase over time.",
    "feedback_c": "This option is incorrect. This statement describes the total number but fails to compare growth rates between different years, which is what 'not increased uniformly' means.",
    "feedback_d": "This is the correct answer. This choice directly compares the growth in two different periods (2020-2021 vs. 2021-2022), showing that the increase was significantly larger in the second period. This is a perfect example of a 'non-uniform' increase.",
    "passage_content": "According to a study released by The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the number of electric cars registered in the United Kingdom has increased dramatically over the years, showing increasing customer preference for battery-electric cars over traditional cars.

    "correct_answer": "were able to locate living specimens that could provide enough information for a positive identification.",
    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice C is the best answer. The third sentence refers to \"\"a molecular examination\"\" which established genetic relationships with other species. Therefore, the biologists must have had molecules from actual salamanders to work with. In other words, they must have found at least one specimen in the wild to compare with the four Thai Tylototriton species. Distractor Explanation: All of the other choices are incorrect because a molecular examination only of the species that were available, not using T. phukhaensis, would not be able to determine the molecular characteristics of T. phukhaensis well enough to know what species are related or not. The other choices all give scenarios in which the scientists did not find examples of the new species for comparison.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The original explanation incorrectly selects option C. The text presents a logical progression: a new species was named in 2020, its features were described, and a molecular examination confirmed its relationships. This implies the species was successfully found and studied. The initial speculation from the old photo ('whether the species still existed') is resolved by the positive identification implied by the formal naming and examination. Therefore, locating living specimens (B) is the most logical outcome that allows for the detailed examinations mentioned, contrasting the initial speculation.",
    "feedback_a": "This option describes what biologists would do if they *couldn't* find the new species, which contradicts the successful tone of the passage (naming it, describing its features).",
    "feedback_b": "This is the correct answer. The act of performing a 'molecular examination' and formally naming the species in 2020 strongly implies that living specimens were found, contrasting with the initial speculation about whether it still existed.",

The logical implication is that the companies will not get enough profits back from their investment; the process of creating a cure is \"\"not financially viable\"\" or \"\"will lose money.\"\" Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect because the text does not condemn the decision of the pharmaceutical companies. The tone is neutral and stating the fact that companies have not done research on Menkes disease, rather than saying that the company should invest money even though they will not be able to recoup their losses. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not discuss the stages of the disease or when the disease can be diagnosed. It is possible that the disease could be diagnosed from right after birth or even through prenatal testing before any symptoms have appeared. Choice D is incorrect because, while the text indicates that the disease is linked to the ATP7A gene, it says there is no cure and there is no mention of supplements.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "The passage states two key facts: 1) Menkes disease is 'so rare,' and 2) as a result, 'few pharmaceutical companies are investing in research related to the disease.' The logical connection between these two facts is economic. Pharmaceutical research is extremely expensive. For a very rare disease, the small number of potential patients means a company is unlikely to recoup its investment, let alone make a profit. Therefore, it is not financially viable to pursue a cure.",

    "feedback_d": "This is the correct answer. The paragraph first defines an abstract term ('predictive analytics') and then provides a concrete, familiar example (Netflix) to make that definition easier to understand. The sentence serves a clear and useful rhetorical purpose.",
    "passage_content": null,
    "question_stem": "\"\"Predictive analytics\"\" is a term that is often used with big data. In essence, the term refers to the use of historical data and statistical techniques such as machine learning to make predictions about the future. An example is how Netflix knows what you want to watch before you do, making suggestions based on your past viewing habits. It is important to note that data doesn't just refer to rows and columns in a spreadsheet, but also to more complex files such as videos, images, and sensor data. The writer is considering deleting the underlined sentence. Should the writer make this change?"

Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect because it changes the meaning from big tech companies being overly powerful and a danger to antitrust cases being overly powerful and a danger. Choice C is incorrect because it retains the unnecessary repetition of \"\"big tech companies\"\" and complicates the sentence structure with \"\"he says\"\" set aside by commas. Choice D is incorrect because it repeats \"\"cases\"\" and adds an element of meaning that is not in the original sentences: \"\"in his opinion\"\" makes the big tech companies ones that he decides are big tech.",

A concise way to do this is to turn the second sentence into a relative clause describing 'big tech companies.' The phrase 'which he says are...' effectively does this, modifying 'big tech companies' while attributing the opinion to Omidyar.",
    "feedback_a": "This option creates a nonsensical sentence: '...invested...in antitrust cases that he says are overly powerful...'. This incorrectly implies the *cases* are powerful, not the companies.",
    "feedback_b": "This is the correct answer. It correctly identifies 'big tech companies' as the noun being modified and uses the non-restrictive clause 'which he says are...' to add the information from the second sentence concisely and clearly.",
    "feedback_c": "This option is redundant and awkward. It repeats 'against big tech companies' and uses 'because' incorrectly, creating a clunky and grammatically flawed sentence.",
