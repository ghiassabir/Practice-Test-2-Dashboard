    "explanation_original": "Key Explanation: Choice B is correct. This question can be solved in two ways. The most efficient way to solve the equation is to factor out the 4 from the left side of the equation yielding $4(x+4)=24$. Dividing both sides of the equation by 4 yields $(x+4)=\\frac{24}{4}$, which equates to $(x+4)=6$, which is Choice B. The second way to solve this equation is to subtract 16 from both sides of the equation. The result is $4x+16-16=24-16$ which in turn translates to $4x=8$. Dividing both sides of the equation by 4 gets $x = 2$. However, the question asks for the value of $x +4$, and not $x$, which will then be $2 + 4$, or 6. Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect as this is the value of 4x when 16 is subtracted from both sides of the equation. Choice C is incorrect as this is the value of x. Choice D is incorrect as this answer may be the result of a conceptual error or miscalculation.",
    "explanation_ai_enhanced": "There are two primary methods to solve this problem. The most direct method is to notice the relationship between the expression in the equation and what is being asked.\nMethod 1 (Factoring):\nThe equation is $4x+16=24$. The expression we want to find is $x+4$. Notice that we can factor a 4 out of the left side of the equation: $4(x+4) = 24$. Now, to find the value of $x+4$, we can simply divide both sides by 4: $\\frac{4(x+4)}{4} = \\frac{24}{4}$, which simplifies to $x+4=6$.\nMethod 2 (Solving for x first):\nFirst, solve for x in the equation $4x+16=24$. Subtract 16 from both sides: $4x = 24 - 16$, which gives $4x=8$. Divide by 4: $x=2$. Now substitute the value of x back into the expression $x+4$: $2+4=6$. Both methods yield the same correct answer.",

Thus, the number of male teachers in the school is $35 - 16 = 19$. The number of people in the school is found by adding the number of teachers to the number of students as follows: $245 + 35 = 280$.

To find the second solution solve for x in the second equation by adding 3 to both sides of the equation as follows: $2x - 3 + 3 = -11 + 3$, $2x = -8$, $x=-4$.

Putting the given equation into slope-intercept form $y=mx+b$ by dividing all terms by 5, yields $y = \\frac{4}{5}x + 3$. The m in the slope-intercept form of the equation represents the slope of the line. Therefore, the slope of the line is $\\frac{4}{5}$ and the opposite reciprocal slope is $-\\frac{5}{4}$, which is the slope of the perpendicular line. This makes Choice C the only correct answer.

This simplifies to $y = \\frac{4}{5}x + 3$.\nThe slope of line m is $\\frac{4}{5}$.\n2. **Find the slope of the perpendicular line k:** Perpendicular lines have slopes that are opposite reciprocals. To find the opposite reciprocal of a slope, you flip the fraction and change the sign.\nThe slope of line m is $\\frac{4}{5}$. The reciprocal is $\\frac{5}{4}$.

To find the center of the circle, first transform the equation to its standard form $(x-h)²+(y-k)² = r²$, where (h, k) is the center of the circle and r is its radius. To get the equation in standard form, complete the square. To do this, first, rearrange the terms in the equation to have all the x's and y's near each other as follows: $x²-6x+y²+4y=36$. The standard form of a quadratic equation is ax² + bx + c Next, working with just $x²-6x$, with a = 1 and b = -6, add $(\\frac{-6}{2})²$ or 9 to both sides of the equation to get $x²-6x+9+y²+4y=36+9$. Next, working with just $y² + 4y$, with a = 1 and b = 4, add $(\\frac{4}{2})²$ or 4 to both sides of the equation to get $x²-6x+9+y²+4y+4=36+9+4$ or 49. Next, factoring $x²-6x+9$ yields $(x-3)²$, and factoring $y² +4y+4$ yields $(y+2)²$, to get $(x-3)²+(y+2)² = 49$. Therefore, the center of the circle will be (3, -2). Distractor Explanation: Choice A is incorrect because if the standard form of a circle equation is read incorrectly then (-h, -k) would be incorrectly determined to be the center of the circle. Choice D is incorrect as the x and y coordinates have been reversed. Choice B is incorrect as this is the negative of incorrect Choice D.",
